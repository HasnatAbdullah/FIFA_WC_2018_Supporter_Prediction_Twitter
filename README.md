# FIFA World Cup 2018 Supporter Prediction

This repository contains code and data for predicting supporter preferences and behavior during the FIFA World Cup 2018 using Twitter data. The goal is to analyze social media activities and tweets to gain insights into fan preferences and make data-driven predictions.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Classifications**:
	- Decision Tree: Implementation of a decision tree classifier to predict supporter preferences.
	- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification.
	- Random Forest: Building a random forest classifier to predict supporter preferences.
	- Adaboost: Implementation of the Adaboost algorithm for classification.

2. **Data Balancing**:
	- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Balancing the dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance.

3. **Clustering**:
	- K-means clustering: Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm to identify patterns and group supporters based on their preferences.

4. **Regression**:
	- Linear Regression: Building a linear regression model to predict numerical outcomes related to supporter preferences.
	- Logistic Regression: Implementation of logistic regression to predict binary outcomes, such as team preference.

5. **Deep Learning**:
	- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Utilizing LSTM architecture for sequence modeling and predicting supporter preferences.
	- RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): Implementation of a basic RNN for analyzing sequential data and predicting supporter behavior.
